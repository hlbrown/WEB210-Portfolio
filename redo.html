                    <p>Hi! This is a little about me, my name is Hannah Brown. I am a student at Wake Tech currently taking
                         classes to obtain my associates in Information Technology, Web Development.
                         I decided to switch careers from Law Enforcement to Web Development in the Fall of 2019!
                         I made the switch to have a better schedule that will allow me to spend more time with my kids. 
                         The career switch was a hard decision to make since I loved serving my community. Problem solving and helping other people reach their goals are two things I love to do. 
                         I am fortunate to say Web development has made it possible for me to continue to do both. I fell in love with making websites for local businesses. One of my first freelance web designs was for a local business, Premier Borders, out of Wichita, KS. I previously served with the owner on the same department
                         and when he left to start his own business he reached out for help designing his website via WordPress.
                         I am currently finishing up my associates degree and will be finished in the Spring of 2022. 
                         During the summer of 2021 I will be taking a Coding Bootcamp at UNC Chapel Hill along with classes at Wake Tech</p>
                         <p>I have experience using:<br>
